## FizzBuzz

### Problem Statement
The FizzBuzz program had an issue where "FizzBuzz" was not correctly printed for multiples of 3 and 5.

### Solution
The issue has been fixed in the `0-fizzbuzz.py` file. Now, the FizzBuzz program prints "FizzBuzz" for multiples of 3 and 5 as expected.

## Print Square

### Problem Statement
The JavaScript program for printing a square had issues with the loop, resulting in incorrect square printing.

### Solution
The issue has been fixed in the `1-print_square.js` file. Now, the program correctly prints a square of the given size.

## Sort

The Python implementation of a User class had issues with the `is_valid_password` method.

### Solution
The issue has been fixed in the `3-user.py` file. Now, the `is_valid_password` method works as intended.

## Double Linked List

### Problem Statement
The C implementation of a double linked list had issues with its output.

### Solution
The specific issues with the double linked list implementation have been addressed. Please refer to the code in the `4-delete_dnodeint` directory for the corrected implementation.
